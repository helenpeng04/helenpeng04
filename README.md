## About Me
Iâ€™m especially interested in biostatistics and how data can be used to make better decisions in health and medicine. My work bridges statistics, psychology, and cognitive scienceâ€”currently in the [OAK Lab](https://www.theoaklab.org/), where I study how people learn complex rules. Outside of academics, I recharge by exploring storiesâ€”through books, TV, and mediaâ€”that reveal how people think, connect, and navigate the world.
