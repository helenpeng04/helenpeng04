## About Me

I'm passionate about biostatistics and using data to drive better decisions in health and medicine. My work bridges statistics, psychology, and cognitive science—currently in the [OAK Lab](https://github.com/the-oak-lab/RR_2024), where I study how people learn complex rules.

## 📚 Beyond Academics
